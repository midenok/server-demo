## server-demo: event-driven multi-threaded connection server
Example of mixed asynchronous-synchronous "event loop + worker threads" server model. Such model allows to utilize strengths of both methods: high productivity of accepting connections in event loop and guaranteed concurrency and algorithm simplicity in worker threads.
